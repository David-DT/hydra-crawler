# Hydra Crawler

Hydra Crawler scans the Hydra network to get information about the peers in the network.
This is a fork of the [ARK Crawler](https://github.com/deadlock-delegate/crawler/) so make sure
you sponsor them for their hard work.

## Installation

`npm install`

## Usage

`node . http://<ip>:<port>`

For port use the p2p port, which is 4701 for [Hydra mainnet](http://hydra.iop.global/) or
4702 for [Hydra devnet](http://dev.hydra.iop.global/).
